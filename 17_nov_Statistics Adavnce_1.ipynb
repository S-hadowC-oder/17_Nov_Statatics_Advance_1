    "## 1. Properties of the F-distribution\n",
    "- The F-distribution is not symmetric; it is positively skewed.\n",
    "- It is defined only for positive values (greater than zero).\n",
    "- The shape depends on the degrees of freedom of the numerator (ν1) and the denominator (ν2).\n",
    "- As ν1 and ν2 increase, the distribution approaches normality.\n",
    "- The mean of the F-distribution is ν2/(ν2 - 2) for ν2 > 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Statistical Tests Using the F-distribution\n",
    "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Used to compare the variances between multiple groups.\n",
    "- **F-test for Equality of Variances**: Checks if two populations have the same variance.\n",
    "- The F-distribution is appropriate for these tests as it compares variance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Assumptions for an F-test\n",
    "- Data must be independent and randomly sampled.\n",
    "- Populations should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- Samples must have equal variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Purpose of ANOVA vs. t-test\n",
    "- **ANOVA**: Compares means of three or more groups.\n",
    "- **t-test**: Compares means of two groups.\n",
    "- ANOVA controls the Type I error rate better than multiple t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Using One-Way ANOVA Instead of Multiple t-tests\n",
    "- One-way ANOVA is used to compare more than two groups while controlling the overall Type I error rate.\n",
    "- More efficient and valid than performing multiple independent t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Partitioning Variance in ANOVA\n",
    "- **Between-group variance**: Variance due to group mean differences.\n",
    "- **Within-group variance**: Variance within each group.\n",
    "- The F-statistic is the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance, indicating significant differences between group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Frequentist vs. Bayesian ANOVA\n",
    "- **Frequentist ANOVA**: Uses sample data for hypothesis testing with p-values.\n",
    "- **Bayesian ANOVA**: Provides probability distributions for parameters, handling uncertainty comprehensively.\n",
    "- **Key differences**: Bayesian ANOVA incorporates prior beliefs, unlike frequentist.\n",
